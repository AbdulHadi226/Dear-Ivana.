    <h1 class="title">Dear Ivana..</h1>
    <p class="boxed">Dear Ivana. The prettiest girl on this whole entire earth. Ivana. My gorgeous princess. You are so important to me. I can't go a day without talking to you. I love everything about you. Your personality, your laugh, your smile, your eyes, your lips, your cute chubby cheeks, your cute little nose, your beautiful hair, your body, your gorgeous looking face, your voice, your company, your support, your helpfulness, your touch (even though I've never felt it), your humor, just everything. I love everything about you. I find anything you do cute. Ever since I met you, I haven't been able to take my focus off you ever since. Ever since I saw your face, I haven't been able to take my eye off you ever since. Ivana you mean so much to me. I can't live without you. I can't go a single day without talking to you, my beautiful princess. Only Allah knows how much I love you. Listen baby, I'll always be by your side supporting you. I'm always by your side no matter what. I'd sacrifice my life for you, my gorgeous princess. I'd never do anything to hurt you physically, or emotionally. Baby, ever since you started doing Self Harm again and attempting Suicide, it completely broke me. Every single day I worry that you're dead or did something dangerous. I genuinely cannot live without you my beautiful girl. Baby.. If you ever die due to Suicide, I'd never be able to be happy again. Please baby, if you ever try to do Suicide, think about me. What would I do, Ivana? What would I do. I wouldn't be able to live. I wouldn't be able to be happy. Not at all. If you ever die, it would definitely scar me for years, if not, the rest of my life. I love everything about you Ivana. You brought back my inner child. You brought back the real me. You brought back my true happiness. I cry of the thought of you leaving me, and imagine you dying. Imagine I get the news that you did Suicide. I genuinely cannot be happy without you. Everytime you're not texting me or talking to me, I feel empty. I feel this emptiness. I fear losing you. One of my biggest fears is losing you. If I ever lose you, I don't know what I'd do without you. How could I be happy without you ever again? How could I smile without you ever again? How could I laugh without you ever again? How could I complete my day without you ever again? How could I go on with my day without you ever again? How could I live without you ever again? How could I do anything without you ever again? I can't do anything without you in my life, Ivana. I need you. You're like my life support. If I ever lose you, who am I supposed to tell my problems to? If I ever lose you, who am I supposed to laugh with? Who am I supposed to tell my day about? There's no one.. No one baby. No one besides you. You changed my life. And my life would surely change if you died or I lost you. It surely would. If you ever died by Suicide, I think I'd do the same to be honest.. I don't know... Ever since you came in my life, everything changed. Everything. I started believing in love. Love, Ivana. Love. I thought I'd never feel true love. But you showed me otherwise. You showed true love. The love I had never experienced. Wallahi Ivana, you're the best girl I have met (after my mother). I love you. I love you so much. I fucking love you. Ivana Wallahi I love you so much. I cannot live without you. I cannot function without you. I need you in my life. My heart is obsessed with you. Ivana. Wallahi I love every single thing about you. Wallahi. I love every inch of you. I love you. Please don't ever leave me Ivana. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you so so so so so so so so so so so much. Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah. ðŸ’‹ -Love, Hadi.</p>
